## Description

Fact Attack! is a lightweight app that delivers random images and facts about cats, dogs, and ducks, all at the tap of a button. Using multiple APIs, instantly fetches a fresh picture and an interesting "facto" for the selected animal. Navigation is handled through simple TabViews, letting you switch seamlessly between your favorite animal.

## Motivation

So i made Fact Attack! because obviusly i love these animals, but also, wanted to combine that passion with my journey in learning SwiftUI development. This project was the perfect opportunity to practice asynchronous API calls, explore the MVVM architecture, work with URLSession for networking, and use JSONDecoder() to handle data parsing.

## Built with

- SwiftUI
- Xcode 16.4

## Concepts Used

TabView • JSONDecoder() • Async API Calls • Async Image Loading • task() • do-catch • Access Control • MVVM • @Observable • @MainActor • Privacy Best Practices • get/set • Separation of Concern to name a few

## Showcase

- Something i have to do.

## To-do

- [ ] Fix Duck icon 🦆 in TabView (dark mode appears too dark).
- [ ] Replace default ProgressView with a custom loader or something else.
- [ ] Add animation and improved styling to the main button.
- [ ] Add an “Info” viewSheet with Wikipedia Info and links for each animal. Maybe?
- [ ] Create a custom REST API for duck facts (none currently available that i could find).
- [ ] Add images and GIFs to the README to showcase the app
- [ ] Include a disclaimer that facts are not verified lol

phew.
